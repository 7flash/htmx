# Changes in this fork
- Fix outerHTML swap if parent is null (i.e. too fast clicking for example) : an error would be fired trying to access the parent's properties and block further interactions with the element => now ignored when parent is null
- `hx-error-target` and `hx-error-swap` attributes to allow swapping server's reponse on error (i.e request with a `status >= 300`). Those attributes behave exactly like, respectively, [hx-target](https://htmx.org/attributes/hx-target/) and [hx-swap](https://htmx.org/attributes/hx-swap/)
- `hx-sse-swap` attribute to override `hx-swap` attribute's value for SSE swapping, ie to allow an element to have different swapping behaviours for requests responses & for SSE. Please note that `hx-swap` is used as a fallback in case `hx-sse-swap` is not defined, so this attribute should only be used when necessary, ie to split swapping behaviours apart. 
- The [HX-Trigger](https://htmx.org/headers/hx-trigger/) header in server's response supports a comma-and-space-separated event names list, to send multiple events to trigger without data, and without having to use a JSON format. Sending for example the header `HX-Trigger: myEvent, myOtherEvent` would trigger both the events `myEvent` and `myOtherEvent` on the client
- The event sources array ([SSE](https://htmx.org/attributes/hx-sse/)) is now exposed in the htmx API, so client can add eventListeners to the same sources created by htmx with the [hx-sse](https://htmx.org/attributes/hx-sse/) attribute
- The htmx-indicator is not hidden on request's response if the response has a `HX-Redirect` header set (just a personal visual preference)
- If the target specified to [`htmx.ajax()`](https://htmx.org/api/#ajax) (and so the `targetOverride` passed to `issueAjaxRequest()`) can't be found, an error is thrown (instead of the HTMX default implementation that crawls the hierarchy to find the first `hx-target` specified on a parent element as a fallback)
- [`htmx.ajax()`](https://htmx.org/api/#ajax) supports an additional property `swap` in the `context` argument, to override the swapping behaviour. This argument must be a string and follows the syntax of the attribute [`hx-swap`](https://htmx.org/attributes/hx-swap/)
- In the default HTMX implementation, elements that have an ID have a special treatment during swapping ; if an element with an ID is about to be inserted, and to replace another element with the same ID, for a reason I ignore, HTMX clones the old elements "settling attributes" _(that are, by default, `class`, `style`, `width` & `height`)_ into the new element, then restores the new element initial attributes after the settling. My problem with this ; using a [MutationObserver](https://developer.mozilla.org/fr/docs/Web/API/MutationObserver) to apply style to newly added nodes _(for example a line that should be positionned at current local time with a line of JS in a calendar)_ results in those modifications being reverted by HTMX after the settling. Since this cloning step appears useless to me (maybe am I wrong though ?), I got rid of it here, as well as the `attributesToSettle` property that was only used for that purpose.
